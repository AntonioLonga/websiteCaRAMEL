Hello there! I am Paul Scherer, a PhD student at the Department of Computer Science and Technology supervised by Prof. Pietro Li√≤ and Mateja Jamnik. I am broadly interested in graph representation learning and its applications in biomedicine. I am also passionate about improving open source machine learning research and am an author (or core contributor) of several packages such as [Geo2DR](https://github.com/paulmorio/geo2dr), [PyTorch Geometric Temporal](https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki/pytorch_geometric_temporal), and [PyRelationAL](https://github.com/RelationRx/pyrelational).
