I am a PhD student at the Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Cambridge, supervised by Prof. Pietro Liò. My research investigates applications of machine learning in bioinformatics, with the aim of enhancing our understanding of the complex physiological processes and diseases that occur in living organisms. I am excited about how AI can help us make sense of the vast amounts of _omics_ data that otherwise could not be grasped by the human mind.
