Hi! I'm Charlie, a PhD student in artificial intelligence with Prof Pietro Lió, Prof Sir Tom Blundell and the Cambridge Centre for AI in Medicine (CCAIM), where I am generously supported by AstraZenca and GSK.

I have a background in classical Biochemsitry and a passion for using AI technology to solve problems in structural biology and drug discovery. In particular, I am interested in learning protein dynamics using ML, generative models for structure-based drug design and learning new biology using self-supervised learning.
