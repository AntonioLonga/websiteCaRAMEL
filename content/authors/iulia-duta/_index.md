I'm a 1st-year PhD student supervised by Prof. Pietro Liò and Dr. Ferenc Huszár at the University of Cambridge, Department of Computer Science and Technology, funded by a scholarship from Twitter.

Previously, I spent 5 great years as a Machine Learning Researcher at Bitdefender. I've graduated with valedictorian distinction the BSc in Computer Science from the University of Bucharest in 2016 and the MSc in Artificial Intelligence also from the University of Bucharest in 2018.

My research focuses on Graph Neural Networks. I am particularly interested in developing techniques to extract structured representation from data and to analyse the optimisation process of different graph and hypergraph neural networks.
