Hi! I'm Arian, a PhD student in artificial intelligence and structural biology at the University of Cambridge. I'm fascinated by how we can develop and better apply technologies to understand biological systems. So far this has taken me on a journey through classical biochemistry, scanning whole mouse brains to better understand processes of aging, the neurobiology of sleep & sexual behaviour in animals, deep into the the circuitry of the fruit fly brain to unpick the wiring of innate behaviours and learning & memory, and, finally, to the circus that is deep learning to improve drug discovery.
