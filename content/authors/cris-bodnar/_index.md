Hi there! My name is Cris, and I am a third-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science, University of Cambridge, supervised by Prof Pietro Liò. My research uses applied Topology and Differential Geometry for understanding and developing Geometric Deep Learning models suitable for problems presenting an underlying combinatorial structure. Within this area, I am particularly interested in theoretical questions of practical importance for graph representation learning.
