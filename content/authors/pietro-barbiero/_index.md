I am Ph.D. student at the University of Cambridge (Clare College). My research activity focuses on explainable artificial intelligence, deep learning, and neuro-symbolic models applied to precision medicine. My current projects are related to logic explained networks, relational reasoning, and automatic concept extraction.
