I am Full Professor at the department of Computer Science and Technology of the University of Cambridge. I am a member of the Artificial Intelligence Group and the Cambridge Centre for AI in Medicine.

My research interest focuses on developing Artificial Intelligence and Computational Biology models to understand diseases complexity and address personalised and precision medicine. Current focus is on Graph Neural Network modeling.
