Hi! I’m Simon, a PhD student in artificial intelligence with Prof. Pietro Lió and the the centre for doctoral training for artificial intelligence for environmental risk (AI4ER) at the Uni of Cambridge. I know, it’s a mouthful!

I work at the intersection of artificial intelligence, biology and climate change. In particular, I reserach on using artificial intelligence to tap into biology’s potential to mitigate environmental problems (via protein design, enzyme optimisation) and on developing artificial intelligence to understand the impacts of changing environmental conditions on biological systems (protein stability, metabolic modelling).
