I am a PhD student at the Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Cambridge, supervised by Prof. Pietro Liò. My research aims to explore the intersection of Graph and Geometric Deep Learning with applications in biology and drug discovery. In the long run, I am excited about how AI can accelerate and augment scientific discovery, from novel medicine to energy-efficient materials.
