I am a Research Scientist at DeepMind, part of the Deep Learning team. In March 2021, I completed my PhD at the Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Cambridge, where I was supervised by Prof Pietro Liò and a member of King’s College.

My professional experience includes undergraduate Software Engineering internships at Google and Facebook. During the PhD, I was a Research Intern at Mila, an AI Resident at X, an ML consultant for Relation Therapeutics and a Research Scientist intern at DeepMind, hosted by Piotr Mirowski in the Robotics, Embodied Agents and Lifelong learning team. I have also been active in the research community, having most recently co-organised the ViGIL workshop at NAACL 2021.
