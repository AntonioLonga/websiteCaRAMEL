I am a full Professor of Artificial Intelligence in the Department of Computer Science and Technology (Computer Laboratory) at the University of Cambridge, UK. I am also an associate fellow at the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence. Recently I served as Specialist Adviser to the House of Lords Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence. I founded the women@CL initiative.

I am interested in human intuitive reasoning and want to make computers think intuitively too. I build computational models that capture human informal reasoning - I am essentially trying to humanise computer thinking. I combine AI reasoning with machine learning techniques, and apply them to personalise medicine and tutoring systems.

Broadly, my research is in the areas of artificial intelligence, human-like computation, machine learning, automated reasoning, diagrammatic reasoning, knowledge representation, theorem proving, cognitive science, human-computer interaction.
